            **Promise Bansah**  
            I am a researcher and data scientist passionate about using data for positive social impact through evidence-based research, particularly in Africa. 
            With a strong foundation in epidemiology, public health, biostatistics, and data science, I have developed my skills in data analytics, machine learning, 
            and data visualization.
            My previous and current experiences have demonstrated my ability to apply data science to address complex challenges, such as developing a model 
            to predict pneumonia using X-ray images by applying deep learning techniques. 
            In my current project, *Prediction of Malaria Recurrence in Children Under 5 Years After ACT Treatment Using Machine Learning Models in the Central Region of Ghana*, 
            I am particularly focusing on environmental or climate factors that could contribute to recurrent malaria among children under 5 years. 
            I am enthusiastic and eager to contribute to the development of predictive models and their deployment for quality healthcare in Africa. 
            I am seeking opportunities to join a dynamic lab or fellowship to learn, adapt, and apply an entrepreneurial approach to problem-solving 
            to contribute to data-driven solutions for sustainable development.
