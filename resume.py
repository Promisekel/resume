            **Promise Bansah** I am a researcher and data scientist passionate about using data for positive social impact through
            evident-based research, particularly in Africa. With a strong foundation in epidemiology, public health, biostatistics
            and data science and machine learning, I have developed my skills in data analytics, machine learning and data visualization.
            My previous and current experiences have demonstrated my ability to apply data science to address complex challenges,
            such as developing a model to predict pneumonia using x-ray image by applying deep learning techniques. 
            In my current project ‚Äúprediction of malaria recurrence in children under 5 years after ACT treatment using machine learning models 
            in the Central Region of Ghana.‚Äù Particularly focusing on environmental or climate factors or features that could contribute
            to recurrent malaria among children under 5 years. I am enthusiastic and eager to contribute to the development of predictive
            model and deploy for quality healthcare in Africa. I am seeking opportunities to join a dynamic lab or fellowship to learn, adaptability, 
            and apply an entrepreneurial approach to problem solving to contribute to data-driven solutions for sustainable development..
